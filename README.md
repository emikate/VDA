Throughout this semester I have learned a lot and gained new data and computer science skills. I
used Python to complete exploratory data analysis on Spotify data and practice my skills using predictive
modeling to see if I could use the audio features to make predictions. I then moved over to HTML,
javascript/D3 to present the results and replace many of the plots I made in Python using D3’s plotting
libraries for javascript, which was completely new to me and the part I struggled with the most. I found
that having more control over the data for plotting is a lot harder in D3 and I needed to do a lot of research
and trial and error to facilitate the process. However, I was able to reproduce many of these plots and
make them more interactive using mouse hovering helping me to gain confidence in my abilities and
problem-solving skills. Additionally, throughout this process, I began to see overall the real-world
applications that can come from research like this. Raw data can tell you a lot, and I can see these
processes being used to create music recommendation systems or genre classification algorithms. For
example, analyzing the clusters found in my analysis could help to create diverse playlists that cater to a
user’s mood or preferences. I believe with a little more practice I can confidently and expertly use D3 in
upcoming projects in my career to give my visualizations a cleaner, more interactive, and appealing
appearance
